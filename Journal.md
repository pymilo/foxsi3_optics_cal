# Journal

## May-20

* Creating this Github repository: https://github.com/pymilo/foxsi3_optics_cal 

* Two folders are created: 
	* Notebooks: The Goal is to have "disorganized" work notebook to do experiments.
	* Py_files: The Goal is to create "organized" enumerated files with concrete tasks that can be run on terminal, following the experiments ran in the notebooks.

## May-21

Created 00, 01, and 02 files that play with 2D gaussians and fit them. 

* To do: Py file with a customized model.




# May 30 - Talk with Steve Christe (at the RHESSI Workshop):

* Organize a telecom to discuss the methods we have used to analyse the SLF data.
* Organize the Notebooks by topics.
* Example: “Let me explore off-axis PSF” Keep it short and simple.
* Keep both Py and Notebook folders: Organized! 
* Mess with the notebooks first and then create the PY files.

* Talk with Säm to see if I can go to Goddard in the Summer.
* Frequency: At least 4 times a year (a week each time).
* One Summer and One on Fall.
* After July 13th I’m free to go. It seems to be OK with Steve’s schedule so far.

* Involve Pascal on the PSF discussion. Give conclusions to Steve.
This is another good excuse to have clear and concrete Py files. 

* Start using NDCube - WCS - for standardize all the Units.
* So far it uses astropy.wcs - What we want is a more natural way to move among units (pixels - arcsec for example). Dan Ryan could help with this

* Cut traveling Milo! 

* Repositories - Create (open) Pull requests and ask Steve to look it out.
* This will be useful for other people to watch my progress.

* Include a journey path inside the journal. Lay it down. Where I’m heading. The pull requests should reach those milestones.
